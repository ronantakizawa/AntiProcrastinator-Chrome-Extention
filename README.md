# AntiProcrastinator-Chrome-Extention
This chrome extension is a to-do list where the user can focus on one task at a time. With normal to-do lists, users can often procrastinate important tasks by looking over other tasks and completing them. With this chrome extension, users can add tasks, but can only see the oldest task added until it is complete. After completion, the task that was added after the completed task can be visible.
